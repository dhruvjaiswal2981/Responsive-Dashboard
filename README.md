# My Dashboard

This is a responsive web and mobile dashboard application built using ReactJS. The dashboard dynamically displays data, includes interactive components, and provides a seamless user experience across various devices.

## Project Description

### Objectives

- Develop a fully responsive web and mobile dashboard application.
- Dynamically display data and include interactive components.
- Ensure seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Requirements

#### Responsive Design
- Ensure the dashboard is fully responsive and provides an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout and ensure cross-browser compatibility.

#### Web Dashboard
- Create a web dashboard with the following sections:
  - **Header**: Contains navigation links, user profile, and notification icons.
  - **Sidebar**: Includes links to different dashboard pages (e.g., Overview, Analytics, Settings).
  - **Main Content Area**: Displays a grid of widgets showing various metrics and charts.
  - **Footer**: Contains brief information about the application.

#### Mobile Dashboard
- Adapt the web dashboard layout to a mobile-friendly design.
  - **Header**: Same as web but optimized for mobile view.
  - **Collapsible Sidebar**: Should be hidden by default and accessible via a hamburger menu.
  - **Main Content Area**: Optimized for vertical scrolling, with widgets stacked.

#### Widgets
- Implement interactive widgets for the dashboard, including:
  - **Line chart**: Showing user activity over time.
  - **Bar chart**: Displaying sales data.
  - **Pie chart**: Depicting user demographics.
  - **Recent activity feed**.

#### Data Integration
- Fetch data from a mock API and dynamically populate the widgets.
- Ensure real-time data updates and error handling.

#### State Management
- Use Redux for state management to handle global states and ensure consistency across components.
- Properly structure and modularize Redux code (actions, reducers, store).

#### Form Handling
- Implement a settings page with forms for updating user preferences.
- Use form validation and ensure a smooth user experience.

#### Code Quality
- Follow best practices for React component development.
- Ensure the code is clean, modular, and well-documented.

#### Additional Features
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a toggle feature to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the application for performance, including lazy loading of components and code splitting.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Responsiveness**: The application should work flawlessly on different screen sizes.
- **Interactivity**: Widgets should be interactive and update dynamically based on data changes.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-structured, and documented code following ReactJS best practices.
- **Data Integration**: Proper handling of data fetching, state management, and error handling.
- **UI/UX**: The overall design and user experience should be intuitive and visually appealing.
